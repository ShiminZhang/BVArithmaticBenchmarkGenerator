# How to use(on LINUX):
## Simple Use
1. Build dependencies: ./quick_build_all.sh
2. Generate SMT instances and convert to CNF: ./quick_generate_all.sh

The generated formulas will be in ./nbitadd/assoc ./nbitmult/commu ./nbitadd/assoc ./nbitadd/commu

## Details
The SMT2 formulas are generated by python

Aiger and boolector are used to convert SMT2 formula to cnf

### Compile boolector(with simplifications turned off)
cd boolector/
#### Download and build Lingeling
./contrib/setup-lingeling.sh
#### Download and build BTOR2Tools
./contrib/setup-btor2tools.sh
#### Build Boolector
./configure.sh && cd build && make
### Compile aiger
cd aiger/
./configure.sh && make

## Generate multiplication instances
(in project root folder)

./nbitmult/gen_nbitmult.sh

A simple way to change the range of bits used for instances is to change it in ./nbitmult/gen_nbitmult.sh

To generate commutativity/associativity instances only, if not both, please check the gen() function in the script. The comments there would help.
## Generate addition instances
(in project root folder)

./nbitmult/gen_nbitadd.sh

A simple way to change the range of bits used for instances is to change it in ./nbitmult/gen_nbitadd.sh

To generate commutativity/associativity instances only, if not both, please check the gen() function in the script. The comments there would help.
